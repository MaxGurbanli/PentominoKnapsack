# Pentomino Knapsack Solver

This project is a Java-based solution for solving the Pentomino Knapsack problem. It utilizes JavaFX for graphical representation and Maven for dependency management.

## Description

The Pentomino Knapsack problem is a computational challenge that involves fitting pentomino pieces into a defined space efficiently. This project provides an interactive way to visualize and solve this problem using Java.

## Features

- Interactive 3D visualization of pentomino pieces.
- Efficient algorithm for solving the Pentomino Knapsack problem.
- User-friendly interface for easy manipulation and observation of the solution process.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Java and Maven installed on your system.

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/MaxGurbanli/PentominoKnapsack.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd PentominoKnapsack
3. Use Maven to compile and run the project:

## Usage

After running the application, you can interact with the 3D visualization to view how pentomino pieces are fitted into the space. The interface allows for rotation, zooming, and other interactions for a comprehensive view.
